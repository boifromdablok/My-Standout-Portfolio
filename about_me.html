            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>I'm a final-year engineering student ready to step into the professional world through an internship. I've worked on several projects throughout my coursework and possibly some personal initiatives too, covering areas such as robotics, renewable energy systems, and software development. Each project has honed different technical skills, from coding in Python to designing efficient solar-powered systems.</p>
            <p>However, capturing the attention of potential employers amidst a sea of other applicants is a formidable challenge. I aspire to have a compelling way to showcase my projects, skills, and unique capabilities. In this digital age, a captivating portfolio website can serve as a dynamic platform to highlight my engineering prowess and set me apart from other candidates.</p>
