                <h2>Robotics Project</h2>
                <p>This project involved designing and building an autonomous robot capable of navigating complex environments. The robot utilized various sensors, including ultrasonic and infrared sensors, to detect and avoid obstacles. I programmed the control system using C++ and integrated it with the hardware components. The project enhanced my skills in embedded systems, robotics programming, and real-time problem-solving.</p>

                <h2>Renewable Energy Systems Project</h2>
                <p>In this project, I focused on designing a renewable energy system for a small residential building. The system combined solar panels and wind turbines to provide a sustainable energy solution. I conducted an in-depth analysis of energy consumption patterns and optimized the system for maximum efficiency. The project helped me develop skills in energy system design, sustainability analysis, and the use of simulation software such as MATLAB and Simulink.</p>

                <h2>Software Development Project</h2>
                <p>For this project, I developed a web application for managing tasks and projects. The application was built using a modern web development stack, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js for the front end, and Node.js with Express for the back end. I implemented user authentication, real-time updates using WebSockets, and a responsive design. This project enhanced my full-stack development skills and taught me how to manage and deploy web applications efficiently.</p>

                <h2>Solar-Powered Systems Project (Python)</h2>
                <p>This project aimed to design and simulate an efficient solar-powered system using Python. I developed algorithms to optimize the placement and orientation of solar panels for maximum energy generation. The system included a monitoring tool to track performance and energy output. This project enhanced my programming skills in Python, data analysis, and application of renewable energy principles.</p>
